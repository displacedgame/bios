        <h3>Thomas Schaffner</h3>
            <p> 
                Thomas is a junior at Tufts university majoring in computer science. When he’s not coding or studying, he’s usually reading sci-fi, practicing Kung Fu, or playing games. Within computer science, Thomas has varied interests: from computation theory to backend web development. Thomas grew up in Lexington MA and draws his interest in both CS and games from his father.
            </p>

        <h3>Jimmy Kim</h3>
            <p>
                While a Biopsychology major getting prepared for medical school, Jim has immense interest for web development, game development, passive portfolio management, and venture capitalism. His favorite pastimes include Mixed Martial Arts, pickup soccer, and making bad jokes.
            </p>
        <h3>Chris Shultz</h3>
            <p>
                Chris is studying Human Factors Engineer at Tufts. He likes music, dance, design, and sports. When you can’t find him doing work in Tisch, you probably just aren’t looking in the right place. Chris is super serious about gaming and owns every gaming console ever made, such as an original xbox. Actually, he only owns an original xbox and nothing else, meaning he hasn’t purchased a new game since NBA Live ‘04. 
            </p>
        <h3>Matt Long</h3>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Matt is a computer science major studying at Tufts University. His hobbies consist of playing Ultimate Frisbee, street percussion, and teaching younger nerds the ways of computer science too. His favorite game of all time is BioShock, although lately he’s gotten really into purchasing games and then dreaming about playing them since his schedule doesn’t allow him to actually play them.
